# Work_it_out

This is a work-out tracking application. This application allows the user to log cardio and resistence excersice workouts.  The user is able to then log the specifics of that workout (reps, sets, time etc...) in order to also track their progress and create whole workouts.  If the user is interested, they can also track the statistics of their workout to track their progress and see the collective hours put in.  This application is supported with a fully functioning independent database created with mongoose and is served up via express and heroku.
